The PolarPlot Quark
===================
_A polar plot for single and multichannel data._

Radial plotting for SuperCollider, useful for plotting things like microphone patterns, cylindrical/spherical harmonics, etc.

The plot is comprised of multiple layers—grid lines, data plot, title, and legend—each with their own settable attributes.
